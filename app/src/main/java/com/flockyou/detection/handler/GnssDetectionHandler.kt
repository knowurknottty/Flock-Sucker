/**
 * Detection handler for GNSS (GPS/satellite) spoofing and jamming attacks.
 *
 * Handles all GNSS-related detection methods:
 * - GNSS_SPOOFING: Fake satellite signals attempting to manipulate position
 * - GNSS_JAMMING: Signal blocking/degradation attacks
 * - GNSS_SIGNAL_ANOMALY: Unusual signal characteristics (too uniform, abnormal levels)
 * - GNSS_GEOMETRY_ANOMALY: Impossible satellite positions
 * - GNSS_SIGNAL_LOSS: Sudden loss of satellite signals
 * - GNSS_CLOCK_ANOMALY: Timing discontinuities suggesting manipulation
 * - GNSS_MULTIPATH: Severe reflection interference (urban canyons, indoor)
 * - GNSS_CONSTELLATION_ANOMALY: Unexpected constellation behavior
 *
 * Performs:
 * - Constellation fingerprinting (GPS/GLONASS/Galileo/BeiDou/QZSS/SBAS/IRNSS)
 * - C/N0 baseline deviation tracking
 * - Clock drift accumulation analysis
 * - Satellite geometry validation
 * - Spoofing/jamming likelihood calculation
 *
 * ===================================================================================
 * REAL-WORLD GNSS CONFIRMATION AND VALIDATION METHODS
 * ===================================================================================
 *
 * When GNSS anomalies are detected, these cross-validation methods help confirm
 * whether the anomaly is a genuine attack or environmental/equipment issue:
 *
 * CONFIRMATION METHOD 1: Cell Tower Triangulation Comparison
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * - Compare GPS-reported position with cell tower-derived position
 * - Cellular position accuracy: 50-300m in urban, 1-10km in rural
 * - If GPS says you're in Moscow but cell towers say Los Angeles = SPOOFING
 * - Android: Use FusedLocationProvider with PRIORITY_BALANCED_POWER_ACCURACY
 *
 * CONFIRMATION METHOD 2: WiFi Positioning System (WPS) Comparison
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Compare GPS position with WiFi-based geolocation
 * - WiFi positioning accuracy: 15-40m where WiFi APs are mapped
 * - Spoofing GPS doesn't affect WiFi positioning databases
 * - Discrepancy > 1km in urban area = highly suspicious
 *
 * CONFIRMATION METHOD 3: Accelerometer/IMU Consistency
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * - Compare GPS-derived velocity with accelerometer-integrated velocity
 * - If GPS shows 100 km/h but accelerometer shows stationary = SPOOFING
 * - Check for "teleportation" - position jumps that violate physics
 * - Maximum human running: ~12 m/s, vehicle: depends on context
 *
 * CONFIRMATION METHOD 4: Altitude Sanity Check
 * --------------------------------------------
 * - Spoofing often gets altitude WRONG (harder to fake correctly)
 * - Compare GPS altitude with:
 *   - Barometric altimeter (if available)
 *   - Known terrain elevation at position (DEM lookup)
 *   - Recent altitude history (sudden 1000m jump = suspicious)
 *
 * CONFIRMATION METHOD 5: Time Source Comparison
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * - Compare GPS time with NTP server time
 * - GPS provides time accurate to ~100ns, NTP to ~10ms
 * - If GPS time differs from NTP by > 1 second = SUSPICIOUS
 * - Meaconing attacks shift time proportionally to position error
 * - Formula: position_error_meters = time_error_seconds * 299,792,458
 *
 * CONFIRMATION METHOD 6: Multi-Device Comparison
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * - Ask users nearby if they see the same anomaly
 * - If only YOUR device is affected = personal device issue or targeted attack
 * - If multiple devices affected = regional spoofing/jamming operation
 * - Fleet tracking systems can compare across vehicles
 *
 * CONFIRMATION METHOD 7: Galileo OSNMA Authentication
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * - Galileo (EU) has Open Service Navigation Message Authentication since 2023
 * - Provides cryptographic proof that navigation message is genuine
 * - Spoofing detection: authentication failure = CONFIRMED spoofing
 * - Requires compatible receiver and processing capability
 *
 * USER CONFIRMATION STEPS (suggest to user):
 * ------------------------------------------
 * 1. "Compare your GPS location to what your carrier shows for E911"
 *    - Call carrier customer service or use carrier app
 *    - E911 location uses cell towers, not GPS
 *
 * 2. "Check if Google Maps traffic layer loads correctly for your position"
 *    - Traffic data is server-side, based on actual road network
 *    - If traffic shows for wrong area, GPS is being spoofed
 *
 * 3. "Ask someone nearby if their GPS shows the same anomaly"
 *    - Single-device issue vs regional attack
 *    - Compare across different phone brands/models
 *
 * 4. "Try airplane mode for 30 seconds, then re-acquire GPS"
 *    - Forces GPS cold start, may break spoofer lock
 *    - Note if position suddenly "jumps" when re-acquiring
 *
 * 5. "Check if your device time drifted significantly"
 *    - Open Settings > Date & Time
 *    - If time is wrong by minutes/hours after GPS use = meaconing attack
 *
 * 6. "Move 100+ meters and check if position updates correctly"
 *    - Spoofing may create "sticky" position that doesn't update
 *    - Or may track your movement incorrectly
 *
 * 7. "Check position against visual landmarks"
 *    - Can you see the building/intersection GPS claims you're at?
 *    - Kremlin spoofing victims saw they were NOT at Vnukovo Airport
