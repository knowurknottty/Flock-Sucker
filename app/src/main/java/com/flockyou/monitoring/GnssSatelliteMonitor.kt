/**
 * GnssSatelliteMonitor - Collects raw GNSS satellite data for spoofing/jamming detection
 *
 * Collects:
 * - Satellite positions (azimuth, elevation)
 * - Signal-to-noise ratios (C/N0)
 * - Constellation info (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, QZSS, SBAS, IRNSS)
 * - Ephemeris/almanac availability
 * - Carrier frequency info
 * - Raw measurements (pseudorange, Doppler, carrier phase)
 *
 * Detects:
 * - GNSS spoofing (inconsistent C/N0, impossible satellite positions)
 * - GNSS jamming (sudden signal loss across all satellites)
 * - Constellation anomalies (unexpected satellite configurations)
 * - Multipath interference
 *
 * ===================================================================================
 * ANDROID GNSS API FEASIBILITY AND CHIPSET CONSIDERATIONS
 * ===================================================================================
 *
 * GnssStatus API (Android 7.0 / API 24+):
 * -----------------------------------------
 * - Available on ALL devices with GPS, provides: satellite count, C/N0, elevation,
 *   azimuth, constellation type, ephemeris/almanac flags, usedInFix.
 * - Carrier frequency (hasCarrierFrequencyHz): Android 8.0+ (API 26), but
 *   chipset-dependent. Qualcomm Snapdragon 845+ and Samsung Exynos 990+ support
 *   dual-frequency (L1+L5); older/budget chipsets report L1 only or null.
 * - Baseband C/N0 (hasBasebandCn0DbHz): Android 11+ (API 30), chipset-dependent.
 *   Provides pre-AGC signal strength useful for jamming detection. Not available
 *   on most MediaTek chipsets as of 2025.
 *
 * GnssMeasurementsEvent API (Android 7.0 / API 24+):
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * - Provides raw pseudorange, carrier phase, Doppler, and clock data.
 * - CRITICAL: Availability is chipset-dependent, NOT just API-level dependent.
 *   - Qualcomm Snapdragon 835+: Full raw measurements supported.
 *   - Samsung Exynos 9810+: Supported, but carrier phase may have quality issues.
 *   - MediaTek Dimensity 700+: Partial support; older MediaTek chips (Helio series)
 *     often return STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED.
 *   - Google Tensor (Pixel 6+): Full support via Samsung/Exynos modem.
 * - Clock bias/drift accuracy varies significantly between chipsets. Qualcomm
 *   provides the most reliable clock data for drift analysis.
 * - Hardware clock discontinuity count (hardwareClockDiscontinuityCount):
 *   Android 9.0+ (API 28). Essential for distinguishing real clock anomalies
 *   from normal receiver resets.
 *
 * AGC (Automatic Gain Control) for Jamming Detection:
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * - AGC level is the primary hardware indicator for RF jamming detection.
 * - NOT available via standard Android GNSS APIs as of Android 14 (API 34).
 * - Some chipsets expose AGC via vendor-specific HAL extensions or
 *   GnssMeasurement.getAutomaticGainControlLevelDb() (added experimentally).
 * - Qualcomm: May expose via QMI/DIAG interface (requires system/root access).
 * - Without AGC, jamming detection relies on indirect indicators: satellite
 *   count drop, C/N0 degradation, and loss of fix.
 * - Our jamming detection uses these indirect methods which work across all
 *   chipsets but have higher false positive rates than AGC-based detection.
 *
 * HDOP/PDOP (Dilution of Precision):
 * ------------------------------------
 * - Android does not expose DOP values directly via GnssStatus.
 * - Location.getAccuracy() provides horizontal accuracy in meters, which is
 *   derived from HDOP internally but does not expose the raw DOP value.
 * - Some vendor implementations populate DOP via Location extras bundle
 *   (non-standard, unreliable across devices).
 * - Our geometry analysis uses elevation/azimuth distribution as a proxy for
 *   DOP, which is available on all chipsets.
 *
 * GrapheneOS Location Privacy Impact:
 * ------------------------------------
 * - GrapheneOS can redirect location requests through its privacy proxy,
 *   which may affect raw GNSS measurement availability.
 * - "Sensors Off" quick tile disables all GNSS hardware access entirely.
 * - Location permissions in GrapheneOS may restrict GnssMeasurementsEvent
 *   callbacks even when ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION is granted, depending on the
 *   per-app sensor permission toggles.
 * - Mock location detection: GrapheneOS allows per-app mock location
 *   providers without developer options, which can affect position data
 *   without affecting raw GNSS measurements (detectable discrepancy).
 *
 * Chipset Detection Strategy:
 * ----------------------------
 * - We register for GnssMeasurementsEvent and handle STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED
 *   gracefully, falling back to GnssStatus-only analysis.
 * - Clock drift analysis requires GnssMeasurementsEvent; if unavailable,
 *   the CLOCK_ANOMALY detection pattern is effectively disabled.
 * - Multipath indicator (GnssMeasurement.getMultipathIndicator()) is
 *   chipset-dependent; many budget chipsets always return UNKNOWN.

 * ===================================================================================
 * REAL-WORLD GNSS SPOOFING/JAMMING KNOWLEDGE BASE
 * ===================================================================================
 *
 * KNOWN SPOOFING SCENARIOS:
 * -------------------------
 * 1. Russian GPS Spoofing (Kremlin Circle Pattern):
 *    - Documented around Moscow Kremlin since 2017
 *    - Ships in Black Sea report being located at Vnukovo Airport (37km away)
 *    - Creates "circular" spoofing pattern centered on protected location
 *    - GLONASS (Russian system) often unaffected - key detection indicator
 *    - Affects GPS L1 C/A code primarily; military P(Y) code harder to spoof
 *    - Detection: If GPS shows anomaly but GLONASS is consistent, suspect spoofing
 *
 * 2. Iranian GPS Spoofing (RQ-170 Drone Capture, 2011):
 *    - Gradually shifts position to lead aircraft to wrong location
 *    - "Meaconing" technique: record and replay real signals with modified timing
 *    - Position drift is gradual (meters per second) to avoid detection
 *    - Detection: Look for steady position drift in one direction over time
 *
 * 3. Chinese GPS Interference (Shanghai Port):
 *    - Documented interference in Shanghai Huangpu River area
 *    - Affects commercial shipping GPS receivers
 *    - May be inadvertent from nearby military installations
 *    - Detection: Regional pattern affecting multiple vessels simultaneously
 *
 * 4. Trucking/Fleet Spoofing (Privacy-motivated):
 *    - Drivers hiding location from employer tracking systems
 *    - Typically single-frequency, affects GPS L1 only
 *    - Low power, affects only the vehicle with the device
 *    - Detection: Single device affected while others nearby are normal
 *
 * 5. Pokemon GO / Gaming Spoofing:
 *    - Consumer-grade, very weak signal
 *    - Typically software-only (mock location providers)
 *    - Does not affect raw GNSS measurements, only location API
 *    - Detection: Raw GNSS measurements normal, but reported location impossible
 *
 * SPOOFING SIGNATURE DETECTION:
 * -----------------------------
 * - ALL satellites same signal strength = STRONG spoofing indicator
 *   (Real sky: signals vary 10-20 dB based on elevation, atmosphere)
 * - ALL satellites same elevation angle = spoofing
 *   (Real sky: satellites range from horizon to zenith)
 * - Carrier phase discontinuities = meaconing or replay attack
 *   (Replay attacks can't maintain phase coherence)
 * - Navigation message bit errors = possible attack
 *   (Legitimate broadcasts have FEC and parity protection)
 * - C/N0 significantly higher than expected = nearby transmitter
 *   (Space-based signals have max ~55 dB-Hz; stronger suggests terrestrial)
 * - Position drifts steadily in one direction = gradual spoofing attack
 *   (Iranian-style "lead away" attack)
 *
 * JAMMING VS SPOOFING DIFFERENTIATION:
 * ------------------------------------
 * - JAMMING: Total signal loss, no fix possible, AGC increases dramatically
 *   - Noise floor rises across all frequencies
 *   - Receiver reports "no satellites" or very weak signals
 *   - Recovery is immediate when jamming stops
 *
 * - SPOOFING: Fix acquired but position is WRONG
 *   - Signals appear healthy (good C/N0, proper modulation)
 *   - Position is internally consistent but externally wrong
 *   - May see position "jump" when spoofing starts/stops
 *
 * - MEACONING: Delayed replay of real signals (hardest to detect)
 *   - Signals are genuine but time-shifted
 *   - Position error is proportional to delay
 *   - Detection: Compare with authenticated time sources (NTP, Galileo OSNMA)
 *
 * CONSTELLATION-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE:
 * ---------------------------------
 * - GPS (USA): Most commonly spoofed; L1 C/A code is publicly documented
 * - GLONASS (Russia): FDMA-based, harder to spoof all frequencies simultaneously
 * - Galileo (EU): Has OSNMA authentication (since 2023) - detect auth failures!
 * - BeiDou (China): Primarily Asia-Pacific coverage; suspicious if strong elsewhere
 * - QZSS (Japan): Japan region only; suspicious if strong signal outside coverage
 * - IRNSS/NavIC (India): India region focused; geostationary component
 *
 * ENVIRONMENTAL FALSE POSITIVE AWARENESS:
 * ---------------------------------------
 * - Urban canyons: Multipath is NORMAL, signals bounce off buildings
 * - Indoors: Weak/no signal is NORMAL, not jamming
 * - Near water: Strong reflections are common (specular multipath)
 * - Mountains: Poor satellite geometry can be legitimate
 * - Dense forest: Signal attenuation of 10-20 dB is expected
 * - Parking garages: Near-total signal loss is normal
 *
 * TECHNICAL BACKGROUND (FOR LLM ANALYSIS):
 * ----------------------------------------
 * - Ephemeris: Precise orbital parameters valid for ~4 hours
 *   - Allows receiver to predict satellite positions
 *   - Spoofing may provide stale ephemeris (detectable)
 *
 * - PRN Codes: Pseudo-random sequences unique to each satellite
 *   - GPS C/A code: 1023 chips, 1ms period
 *   - Spoofing must generate correct PRN for claimed satellite
 *
 * - Multi-constellation: Attacker must spoof ALL systems coherently
 *   - GPS + GLONASS + Galileo = very difficult to spoof together
 *   - Cross-constellation consistency check is powerful defense
 *
 * - RAIM (Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring):
 *   - Requires 5+ satellites to detect single faulty signal
 *   - Requires 6+ satellites to exclude faulty signal
 *   - Modern receivers implement RAIM; check its status

     * STAGE 1 - Confirmation Period:
     * Each anomaly type has its own confirmation requirement (see [ANOMALY_CONFIRMATION_REQUIREMENTS]).
     * Multiple detections within a time window are required before an anomaly is reported.
     * This prevents transient conditions (cold start, brief obstruction) from generating alerts.
     * Confirmation requirements by type:
     *   - SPOOFING_DETECTED:     6 detections in 2 minutes
     *   - JAMMING_DETECTED:      6 detections in 2 minutes
     *   - SIGNAL_UNIFORMITY:     8 detections in 5 minutes
     *   - CLOCK_ANOMALY:        10 detections in 5 minutes
     *   - MULTIPATH_SEVERE:     10 detections in 10 minutes
     *   - IMPOSSIBLE_GEOMETRY:   6 detections in 2 minutes
     *   - SUDDEN_SIGNAL_LOSS:    4 detections in 60 seconds
     *   - CONSTELLATION_DROPOUT: 8 detections in 5 minutes
     *   - CN0_SPIKE:             6 detections in 2 minutes
     *   - ELEVATION_ANOMALY:     8 detections in 5 minutes
     * Exception: CRITICAL confidence bypasses confirmation entirely.
     *
     * STAGE 2 - Rate Limiting (Cooldown):
     * After confirmation, a per-type cooldown prevents duplicate alerts.
     * Default cooldown: [DEFAULT_ANOMALY_COOLDOWN_MS] = 5 minutes (300,000 ms).
     * This cooldown applies uniformly across ALL anomaly types.
     * The cooldown can be adjusted via [updateScanTiming] but should not be set
     * below 60 seconds to avoid alert flooding.
